      "1. The First Hague Convention: The First Hague Convention was signed in 1899 and was designed to protect the rights of civilians in international armed conflicts. It was signed by 31 countries and established the principle that civilians should not be targeted by military forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: In 1904, during the Boxer Rebellion in China, British and French troops were sent to suppress the rebellion. However, they were ordered to avoid killing or injuring the Chinese civilians. The British and French troops complied with this principle and did not fire on the civilians.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Second Hague Convention: The Second Hague Convention was signed in 1907 and established the principle that the use of prohibited weapons in war is prohibited. It was signed by 33 countries and established the principle that the use of prohibited weapons in war is prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: During World War I, the use of poison gas by both the German and British armies was prohibited under the Second Hague Convention. However, the German army still used poison gas and was criticized for its use.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Fourth Hague Convention: The Fourth Hague Convention was signed in 1907 and established the principle that the use of prohibited weapons in war is prohibited. It was signed by 33 countries and established the principle that the use of prohibited weapons in war is prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: During World War II, the use of chemical weapons by both the German and Soviet armies was prohibited under the Fourth Hague Convention. However, the Soviet army used chemical weapons against the Polish army in 1939, which was not a violation of the Hague Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Sixth Hague Convention: The Sixth Hague Convention was signed in 1907 and established the principle that the use of prohibited weapons in war is prohibited. It was signed by 33 countries and established the principle that the use of prohibited weapons in war is prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: During World War II, the use of biological weapons by both the German and Soviet armies was prohibited under the Sixth Hague Convention. However, the Soviet army used biological weapons against the French army in 1942, which was not a violation of the Hague Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are just a few examples of how the Hague Conventions have been used to protect the rights of civilians in international armed conflicts.

      "The Leahy Law is a United States federal law that prohibits the use of federal funds for the adoption or use of certain inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners. The law is named after its sponsor, Senator Patrick J. Leahy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some specific details and examples of the Leahy Law:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment: The Leahy Law prohibits the use of cruel and unusual punishment, which is defined as punishment that is unusual or severe, and that is not authorized by law. This includes punishment that is excessive or unwarranted, and that is not based on a legitimate and accepted principle of justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "* In 2011, the Department of Justice (DOJ) found that the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq violated the Leahy Law by using cruel and unusual punishment against detainees. The DOJ concluded that the abuse was a result of a culture of fear, intimidation, and retaliation that was fostered by the prison's leadership.\n",
      "* In 2015, the DOJ found that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba violated the Leahy Law by using cruel and unusual punishment against detainees. The DOJ concluded that the abuse was a result of a lack of accountability and transparency, and that the facility's leadership fostered a culture of fear and intimidation.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prohibition of torture: The Leahy Law prohibits the use of torture, which is defined as any act that intentionally causes severe physical or mental pain or suffering. The law specifically prohibits the use of waterboarding, which is a technique used to simulate drowning by forcing a person to inhale and hold their breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "* In 2003, the DOJ found that the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq violated the Leahy Law by using torture against detainees. The DOJ concluded that the abuse was a result of a culture of fear, intimidation, and retaliation that was fostered by the prison's leadership.\n",
      "* In 2005, the DOJ found that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba violated the Leahy Law by using torture against detainees. The DOJ concluded that the abuse was a result of a lack of accountability and transparency, and that the facility's leadership fostered a culture of fear and intimidation.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prohibition of inhumane treatment: The Leahy Law prohibits the use of inhumane treatment, which is defined as any treatment that is cruel, inhuman, or degrading. The law specifically prohibits the use of solitary confinement, which is defined as the confinement of an individual for 22 or more hours a day, 7 days a week, for a period of 15 consecutive days or more.\n",

      "1. Prohibition of the use of prisoners as labor: The Leahy Law prohibits the use of prisoners as labor, which is defined as any work or service that is forced or required under threat of punishment. The law specifically prohibits the use of prisoners in activities that are not essential to the operation of the facility, and that are not reasonably related to the prisoner's rehabilitation.\n",

      "Overall, the Leahy Law is a significant federal law that prohibits the use of inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners, and that seeks to ensure that prisoners are treated with respect and dignity. The law is named after its sponsor, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, and was first passed in 1992 as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Hahn and Meitner had died in 1968, but Strassmann was still alive, and he asserted the importance of his analytical chemistry and Meitner\\'s physics in the discovery, and their role as more than just assistants. A detailed biography of Strassmann appeared in 1981, a year after his death, and a prize-winning one of Meitner for young adults in 1986. Scientists questioned the focus on chemistry, historians challenged the accepted narrative of the Nazi period, and feminists saw Meitner as yet another example of the Matilda effect, where a woman had been airbrushed from the pages | Fritz Strassmann | Friedrich Wilhelm Strassmann (22 February 1902 – 22 April 1980) was a German chemist who, with Otto Hahn in early 1939, identified the element barium as a product of the bombardment of uranium with neutrons. Their observation was the key piece of evidence necessary to identify the previously unknown phenomenon of nuclear fission, as was subsequently recognized and published by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch. | George B. Pegram | The discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, followed by its explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in December 1938, ignited a flurry of activity, with nearly one hundred articles on the subject published by the end of 1939. At Columbia, Fermi and Dunning were quick to verify Hahn\\'s and Strassmann\\'s results, and there was a lively debate over whether uranium-235 or its more abundant uranium-238 isotope was primarily responsible. Two groups began working at Columbia on attempting to create a nuclear chain reaction in natural uranium. Both were in the Pupin Physics Laboratories, but working independently, at least initially, and on different floors:\\nFritz Strassmann | the discovery. From 1939 to 1946 working at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute, Strassman contributed to research on the fission products of thorium, uranium, and neptunium. In this way, he contributed to the understanding of the radiochemistry of the actinide elements. Strassmann developed methods for the dating of the age of minerals and other inorganic substances based on the half-life of radioactive elements and the enrichment of decay products. Strassmann and Ernst Walling developed the rubidium-strontium method of radiometric dating in 1936 and 1937, and Strassmann continued this work in 1942 and 1943. His methods are known as emanation methods, and Strassmann\\'s research in this area was fundamental to the field | British contribution to the Manhattan Project | The 1938 discovery of nuclear fission in uranium by Otto Robert Frisch, Fritz Strassmann, Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, raised the possibility that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created. Refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries were particularly alarmed by the notion of a German nuclear weapon project. In the United States, three of them, Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner and Albert Einstein, were moved to write the Einstein–Szilárd letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of the danger. This led to the President creating the Advisory Committee on Uranium. In Britain, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg were sufficiently concerned | History of science | In 1938 Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission with radiochemical methods, and in 1939 Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch wrote the first theoretical interpretation of the fission process, which was later improved by Niels Bohr and John A. Wheeler. Further developments took place during World War II, which led to the practical application of radar and the development and use of the atomic bomb. Around this time, Chien-Shiung Wu was recruited by the Manhattan Project to help develop a process for separating uranium metal into U-235 and U-238 isotopes by Gaseous diffusion. She was an expert experimentalist in beta decay and weak interaction physics.
