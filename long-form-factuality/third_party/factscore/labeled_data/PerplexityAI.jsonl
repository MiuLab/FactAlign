Bin Laden had no formal training in Islamic jurisprudence but was sometimes referred to as a \"sheikh\" and considered by some to be \"well versed in the classical scriptures and traditions of Islam\"[2].\n\nBin Laden became an influential ideologue who first acquired sympathizers in the Islamic world due to his status as a war-hero of the Afghan Jihad and subsequent focus on attacking Western imperialism[1]. His targeting of civilians and hostile activities against Western governments made him a terrorist leader designated as such by the United Nations Security Council[1].\n\nOn May 2, 2011, Bin Laden was killed by US special operations forces at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
