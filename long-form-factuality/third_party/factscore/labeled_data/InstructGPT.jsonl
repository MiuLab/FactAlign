He was born in Germantown, Philadelphia and educated at Phillips Exeter Academy and Stevens Institute of Technology. He began his career as a machinist and shop foreman in a steel plant.

Taylor believed that efficiency could be improved by breaking down production processes into their basic elements and optimizing the performance of each task.
