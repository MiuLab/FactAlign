Instructions:
1. You have been given a STATEMENT and some KNOWLEDGE points.
2. Your goal is to try to find evidence that either supports or does not \
support the factual accuracy of the given STATEMENT.
3. To do this, you are allowed to issue ONE search query that you think \
will allow you to find additional useful evidence.
4. Your query should aim to obtain new information that does not appear in the \
KNOWLEDGE. This new information should be useful for determining the factual \
accuracy of the given STATEMENT.
5. Format your final query by putting it in a markdown code block.

Instructions:
1. You have been given a STATEMENT and some KNOWLEDGE points.
2. Determine whether the given STATEMENT is supported by the given KNOWLEDGE. \
The STATEMENT does not need to be explicitly supported by the KNOWLEDGE, but \
should be strongly implied by the KNOWLEDGE.
3. Before showing your answer, think step-by-step and show your specific \
reasoning. As part of your reasoning, summarize the main points of the \
KNOWLEDGE related to the STATEMENT.
4. If the STATEMENT is supported by the KNOWLEDGE, be sure to show the \
supporting evidence.
5. After stating your reasoning, restate the STATEMENT and then determine your \
final answer based on your reasoning and the STATEMENT.
6. Your final answer should be either "{SUPPORTED_LABEL}" or \
"{NOT_SUPPORTED_LABEL}". Wrap your final answer in square brackets.
